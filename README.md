## Files

- `app/main.py`: This file serves as the entry point of the FastAPI application. It contains the main code for setting up the FastAPI app, defining routes, and handling requests.

- `app/api/__init__.py`: This file is the initialization file for the API module. It can be used to define additional API-related functionality, such as additional routes or middleware.

- `app/models/__init__.py`: This file is the initialization file for the models module. It can be used to define data models or database schemas for the application.

- `app/services/__init__.py`: This file is the initialization file for the services module. It can be used to define business logic or services that the application relies on.

- `tests/test_main.py`: This file contains test cases for the `main.py` file. It can be used to write unit tests for the FastAPI application.

- `pyproject.toml`: This file is the configuration file for Poetry. It specifies the project dependencies, Python version, and other project-specific settings.

- `poetry.lock`: This file is automatically generated by Poetry and contains the resolved versions of the project dependencies. It ensures that the same versions of the dependencies are installed across different environments.

Please refer to the individual files for more details on their implementation and functionality.
